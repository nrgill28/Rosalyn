Welcome to Rosalyn, my custom Discord server moderation bot.
Focused entirely around moderator ease of use, this bot provides multiple functions that aren't found in other moderation bots.

## Notable features
 - Role persists: users will keep persistent roles even if they leave and rejoin the server so they can't just rejoin to be unmuted.
 - Automatic punishment tiering: Server administrators can define punishment rules according to categories and users will incrementally receive the appropriate punishment for having broken a rule in that category enough times.

## Todo
 - Moderation commands
 - Punishment tier system
